# SpigotTimingsPaste

A plugin to paste your timings to the [Spigot Timings](https://timings.spigotmc.org/) instead
of [PMMP Timings](https://timings.pmmp.io/).

# Usage

1. Install the plugin
2. Run `/timings on` to start the timings.
3. Run `/timings paste` to paste the timings to Spigot Timings.
4. See results on provided link.

# How does it work?

Spigot decided to continue to use Timings v1 which is the exact same format as PMMP Timings.

So we can just post data to the Spigot Timings API, and it will work.
